# Runbook

## RPO / RTO
- RPO: 24 hours when `scripts/backup.sh` runs once a day.
- RTO: time to `psql` restore the dump plus copy `api_uploaded` / `api_enrolled` volumes.

## 502 after recreate
`docker compose up -d --build nginx` so the gateway re-resolves `api`. Check `GET /ready`.

## GPU driver mismatch
If `nvidia-smi` says driver/library mismatch, reboot the host so the kernel module matches the userspace libraries. Do not start `dpu-api` until `nvidia-smi` succeeds.

## 413 on import
Host TLS nginx must set `client_max_body_size 500m`. See `docker/nginx/tls-edge.example.conf`.

## Weak SECRET_KEY
The API refuses to start when `AUTH_FAIL_FAST=true` and `SECRET_KEY` is shorter than 32 characters or still `change-me-in-production`. Set a new secret and restart `api`. Existing tokens become invalid.

## Leaked secrets / PII in git
`API-Fast/.env`, 811 face images, a scratch `.xlsx` and a load-test dump were tracked until roadmap A2. They are untracked now but still in history. Follow `docs/SECRETS-REMEDIATION.md` for the `git filter-repo` purge, the key-rotation checklist (`SECRET_KEY`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, Google Maps, Firebase) and the re-clone notice. The Google Maps key is injected at runtime via `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` → `assets/config.json`; change it with `docker compose up -d admin`, no rebuild.

## Kiosk pairing (provision a tablet)
Kiosk tablets no longer receive a token in a URL. Each device is paired once with a short-lived code:

1. Admin: `/company/hr-schedule` → tab **ความปลอดภัย** → enter a device name → **สร้างอุปกรณ์และรหัสจับคู่**. The UI shows an 8-character `pairingCode` (`ABCD-EFGH`) **once**; it expires after `KIOSK_PAIRING_CODE_TTL_MINUTES` (default 10). Equivalent API: `POST /hr/company/{companyId}/kiosk-devices {"name": "..."}`.
2. Tablet: open `https://<host>/kiosk/pair`, type the code, tap **จับคู่อุปกรณ์**. The tablet calls `POST /auth/kiosk/pair`, stores the device token pair in `sessionStorage` for that tab only, and is redirected to `/company/timestamp-face`. The kiosk refreshes its own token via `/auth/kiosk/refresh` (rotation) when the WebSocket reports `token_expiring`.
3. Verify in the admin table: status changes from **รอจับคู่** to **จับคู่แล้ว** and `lastSeenAt` updates.

Operations:
- **Code expired / typo**: click **ออกรหัสใหม่** on the device row (`POST .../kiosk-devices/{deviceId}/pairing-code`). This also revokes any token the device already holds, so use it to force a re-pair after a tablet is lost.
- **Decommission**: **เพิกถอนสิทธิ์** (`DELETE .../kiosk-devices/{deviceId}`). The device token family is denied within `AUTH_REVOCATION_CACHE_SECONDS` (default 30 s) on every replica; the tablet is sent back to `/kiosk/pair` on its next request. Revoked devices cannot be re-paired — register a new device.
- **Tablet closed the tab / cleared storage**: re-issue a code (step above) and pair again.
- **Legacy `?kioskToken=` URLs** (pre-A5, 365-day tokens) still validate until they expire or the device is revoked, but can no longer be issued. Revoke those devices and re-pair them.
- Tuning: `KIOSK_TOKEN_EXPIRE_HOURS` (device token, default 12), `KIOSK_REFRESH_EXPIRE_DAYS` (default 30), `KIOSK_PAIR_MAX_ATTEMPTS_PER_MINUTE` (per-IP brute-force limit at `/auth/kiosk/pair`, default 10).

## Logout, token revocation & refresh rotation
- `POST /auth/logout` (UI: header → Log Out) revokes the access token, the refresh token and their session family (`fam`). The row lives in `revoked_token` until the token would have expired; `revocation_purge_loop` deletes expired rows every `AUTH_REVOCATION_PURGE_SECONDS`.
- Refresh tokens are single use. If a user is unexpectedly logged out with `Refresh token reuse detected`, a refresh token was replayed (stolen copy or two tabs racing on stale storage): the whole session was revoked on purpose. Log in again; investigate if it repeats for the same account.
- To revoke every session of one account without a DB script, reset the password and ask the user to log in again (new family). Existing tokens issued before this release carry no `jti` and expire naturally (access ≤ `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES`, refresh ≤ `REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_DAYS`).
- `?token=` in URLs is rejected. If an old integration still depends on it, set `AUTH_ALLOW_QUERY_TOKEN=true` temporarily; every use is logged as `deprecated ?token= used` so you can find and fix the caller.

## Biometric data
Face vectors in `face_encoding` are required for matching when DPU runs InsightFace itself. In BFF mode Face Core owns embeddings; DPU keeps timestamps and punch photos. `temp_images` can be deleted; the retention loop removes them after `TEMP_RETENTION_HOURS`.

## Face Core down
`/ready` returns 503 `face_core_down` when `FACE_CORE_URL/v1/health` fails. The kiosk shows scan errors and the API opens a 15 second circuit instead of retrying every frame. Restart `face-core-api` on `face-net`, then `dpu-api`.

## Rotate Face Core key
Create a key with `POST /v1/api-keys` on face-core, put it in DPU `.env` as `FACE_CORE_API_KEY`, recreate `dpu-api`, then revoke the old key.

## One GPU down
Stop `face-core-gpu1`. `face-api` on `cuda:0` keeps serving the Redis queue. Start `face-core-gpu1` again when the second card is back.

## Work Shifts & Attendance Export
- Default company shift is `09:00` – `18:00` (`Asia/Bangkok`) with `15` minutes grace period. Update per company via `PUT /timestamp/company/{companyId}/shift-settings`.
- Attendance exports (`GET /timestamp/export/company/{companyId}?format=xlsx|csv`) stream up to 5,000 rows per request.

## Multi-Replica Notification Outbox
- `drain_outbox` uses PostgreSQL `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, making it safe to run multiple `dpu-api` replicas concurrently without duplicate Email / LINE / Webhook deliveries.
- Daily missing-attendance cutoff state is stored in `system_setting` under `key = "cutoff_sent:{companyId}"`.

## Alembic Migrations
Existing databases apply idempotent DDL via `src/utils/schema_migrate.py` at startup. After pulling the latest revisions, run `alembic stamp 0008_revocation_kiosk_pairing` inside `dpu-api` (needs `DATABASE_URL`). Fresh databases can run `alembic upgrade head` after `create_all`. Revision `0007_face_encoding_company_id` adds `face_encoding."companyId"` (backfilled) and revision `0008_revocation_kiosk_pairing` adds `revoked_token` and the kiosk pairing columns on `kiosk_device` (`token_hash` becomes nullable).
